### Home Light Automation
The goal of the project is to turn on the light only when somebody is at home. Subfolders contain the projects for the sensors, controller and actuator:
* "light_sensor_cfg_CC1352R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs" (light sensor)
* "reed_sensor_CC1352R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs" (door sensor)
* "relays_CC1352R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_gcc" (light switch actuator)
* "Controller_and_WebServer" (master controller & webserver)
* "ncp_ftd_CC1352R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_gcc" (border router)
